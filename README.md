# ‚ö° BosBot - Don't use as is - Don't trust, verify! ‚ö°

## **Preconditions:**

BosBot is designed to manage lightning nodes (rebalancing, fee adjustment, connectivity management). In this early state the script has set hardcoded parameters which will be changed in future releases to fit nodes of different shapes and sizes. For now Bosbot assumes that there are enough channels for rebalancing and channel sizes are above 2M satoshis. BosBot collects statistically valuable data to determine convenient parameters for its management routines.
BosBot needs Balance of Satoshi (BoS: https://github.com/alexbosworth/balanceofsatoshis) globally [installed](https://gist.github.com/alexbosworth/8fad3d51f9e1ff67995713edf2d20126#setup-npm).

Tested configuration:
- [LND-0.14.3-beta](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.14.2-beta)
- [BoS 11.64.x](https://github.com/alexbosworth/balanceofsatoshis#install) 
- [npm 8.5.5](https://gist.github.com/alexbosworth/8fad3d51f9e1ff67995713edf2d20126)
- [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org)


## **‚úè Get Started / Usage / Management Switches:**

1) Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/blckbx/bosbot.git`
2) Create your own settings file: `cp .env .env.local` (prevents overwriting personal settings on update via `git pull` but mind changes made to `.env)
3) Edit `nano .env.local` to your needs (see below).
4) At the top of the file set which `MANAGEMENT SWITCHES` should be applied.

- `ALLOW_BOS_RECONNECT`: BosBot checks for offline peers and tries to reconnect them within a given time period
- `ALLOW_SIMPLE_RECONNECT`: BosBot checks for inactive peers and disabled channels and tries to reactivate them quickly via disconnecting and reconnecting
- `ADJUST_POLICIES`: BosBot is permitted to adjust outgoing fees and max htlc sizes of your channels (**experimental!**)
- `ADJUST_POLICIES_FEES` : if false this restricts policy management (setting htlc sizes/fees) to htlc size management only
- `ALLOW_REBALANCING`: BosBot rebalances channels which are depleted to local or remote side (750_000 sats off balance with channel size above 2M)
- `ALLOW_DB_CLEANUP`: BosBot backs up historical payments in json files and marks them for deletion in LND's channel database (compaction required to actually free up space) every `DAYS_BETWEEN_DB_CLEANING` days

5) Adjust Important Settings:

- `MIN_PPM_ABSOLUTE`: minimum fees
- `MAX_PPM_ABSOLUTE`: maximum fees
- `SAFETY_MARGIN`: proportional safety ppm margin
- `SAFETY_MARGIN_FLAT_MAX`: maximum flat safety margin (below this limit: proportional)
- `NUDGE_UP`: max size of fee adjustment upward
- `NUDGE_DOWN_PER_DAY`: max size of fee adjustment downward
- `DAYS_FOR_FEE_REDUCTION`: min days of no routing before allowing fee reduction
- `ROUTING_STOPPING_FEE_RATE`: ppm fees for drained channels
- `MAX_PARALLEL_REBALANCES`: max count of parallel rebalances (high usage of resouces!)
- `TELEGRAM_CHATID` & `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`: Add HTTP API Token (set by BotFather) and chat id (lookup `/id` on Telegram). ‚ö† **A word of caution: Connecting the node with a Telegram ID may expose your identity (registrered telephone number on Telegram)! It's adviced to use a proxy (e.g. Tor, see `.env` settings) to connect to a Telegram bot.** 
- `TELEGRAM_PROXY_HOST` & `TELEGRAM_PROXY_PORT`: add a (Tor) proxy to communicate with Telegram bot (recommended)
- `DB_PATH`: adjust path to channel.db file
- `MINUTES_BETWEEN_BOS_RECONNECTS`: run `bos reconnect` every x minutes
- `MINUTES_BETWEEN_SIMPLE_RECONNECTS`: run simple reconnect every x minutes

6) Fine Tuning:
- Set rules for channels and rebalances (see settings.json): `aliasMatch`, `min_ppm`, `max_ppm`, `no_local_rebalance`, `no_remote_balance`, `max_htlc_sats`, `AVOID_LIST` (nodes to exclude from rebalancing (also in-path))

7) Start Commands:

- `npm start` : starts [BosBot](#-workflow)
- `npm run limiter` : starts [htlcLimiter](#-htlc-limiter--firewall) (logs to screen and file `limiter.log`)
- `npm run monitor` : starts [monitorPeers](#-monitorpeers) (logs to screen and file `events.log`)
- `npm run visualize` : starts [visualizer](#-visualization)
- `npm run nodesinpaths` : starts [nodesInPaths](#-nodes-in-paths)
- `npm run isitdown <alias/pubkey>` : starts [isItDown](#-isitdown)
- `npm run lookup <alias>` : starts [lookup](#-lookup) of a peer's collected data
- `npm run isitsafetorestart` starts [isItSafeToRestart](#-isitsafetorestart)
- `npm run getcapacityfees`: starts [getCapacityFees](#-getcapacityfees)
- `npm run checkchans`: starts [checkChans](#-checkchans)

## **‚ôæ Workflow:**

1) `runReloadSettings()`
2) `runBotReconnectCheck()`
3) `runUpdateFeesCheck()`
4) `runCleaningCheck()`
5) `runSimpleReconnect()`
6) `runBotRebalanceOrganizer()`
7) `runBot()` // repeat every x minutes (`MINUTES_BETWEEN_STEPS`)


## **üß¨ Rebalancing:**

BosBot tries to balance imbalanced channels close to 1:1. Imbalance is detected if a channel's liquidity is `MIN_SATS_OFF_BALANCE` away from perfect balance. Especially depleted channels (liquidity < `MIN_SATS_PER_SIDE` on local or remote side) are treated as rebalance candidates. Rebelance amount is set between `MIN_REBALANCE_SATS` (BoS minimum size) and `MAX_REBALANCE_SATS`, preferably exact off-balance amount. BosBot takes inbound fees (peers' fees) and historic data into account and adds a safety margin before rebalancing (cost effectiveness), so ideally future expected income (future forwards) earns some profit. In addition, BosBot rebalances pairs of local-heavy and remote-heavy channels up to `MAX_PARALLEL_REBALANCES` in parallel.
````

Once rebalancing was successful for the first time, BosBot fires this route again via `bos send` (if allowed) until balance is reached. Sending less amount due to risk of stuck htlcs. The more discount we achieve, the more emojis (up to 5) will be displayed ;)

## **üõ† Fee Adjustment / üöß Max HTLC Sizes per Channel:**

**Experimental Feature! Use with caution!** 

BosBot is applying channel fees based on activity per hours/days or manually if defined in `settings.json`. Fees are adjusted faster upwards than downwards. Best practice: For a new channel set fees initially high and let it drop (automatically with BosBot) until forwards happen. Initial fees have to be set by LND favourably (lnd.conf, bitcoin section). Edge cases can be set in `settings.json`, e.g. no rebalancing to remote side for draining-only channels (like LN exchanges). Furthermore BosBot is setting max htlc sizes for each channel to reduce channel failures on forwards. To obfuscate a channel's balance, max htlc size is calculated to nearest limit of 2^X.

## **üõ° HTLC Limiter / Firewall:**

A module to watch and limit numbers of pending htlcs per channel based on fee policies. In parallel BosBot watches for forwarding requests, calculates the htlc's fee and adds the forward to its fee range (currently 2^X). If the number of pending htlcs within a given fee range exceeds the limit, the forward is rejected. For now there are more htlcs allowed for outgoing than incoming direction. Also it acts as a rate limiter for htlcs. Run `npm run limiter` to start (separate terminal window recommended).

### **üèÜ Scoring / Data Base:**
Bosbot collects historical data (channel stats, fee stats, peer stats) per peer that is used for future fee and rebalancing settings. Data is presented in various ways (node summary, fee changes, flow summary). Flow summary lists all peers sorted by score (routed out + routed in sats). Also routings (sats/day and direction), rebalancings (sats/day, direction and used ppm) and lifetime usage are presented. Additionally it states if a node is being used in a 2-WAY-REBALANCE or if IN-direction is disabled.

### **üìà Visualization:**

Starts up a webservice hosted at http://localhost:7890 or http://(your-local-address/ip):7890 to query some node data. xAxis, yAxis, and rAxis can be set to days, ppm, routed, earned, count (for grouped). Can combine items into xGroups number of groups along x axis. ppm, routed, earned will be plotted in log scale, days in linear. Some example query strings:
- http://localhost:7890/?daysForStats=7&xGroups=0&xAxis=ppm&yAxis=earned&rAxis=routed&any=bfx&out=&from=&roundDown=&type=bubble
- ?daysForStats=7&xGroups=0&xAxis=ppm&yAxis=earned&rAxis=&out=&from=&roundDown=1&type=bubble

### **üíé Nodes in Paths:** ###

Shows most used nodes in past rebalances. Switches `DAYS_FOR_STATS` (how many days to look back) and `SHOW_PEERS` (show already connected peers) are adjustable. For this script to run some data is needed (run index.js at least once, turn off any management switches).


### **üîç Lookup:** ###

Displays data of a specific alias/peer.


### **üî¥ IsItDown:** ###

Query any node's number and percentage of disabled channels towards them to get an overview if it is possibly down or if there are connectivity problems.

````
$ node isitdown alias
~X % of Y channels disabled towards alias
````


### **‚úÖ checkChans:** ###

Checks your channels for inactive and IN/OUT-disabled channels to get a quick overview if strange things are going on.

````
$ node checkChans
                  alias public_key                                     local remote    iRD isSmall lastReconnected isOffline isInActive inDisabledPeers outDisabledToPeers

    peers disabling to me:    0
    me disabling to peers:    2
    disabled both ways:       0

````


### **‚ôª IsItSafeToRestart:** ###

Checks for pending HTLCs and returns an estimation if a restart could be potentially risky due to HTLC expiration.

````
$ node isitsafetorestart
current height is xxxxxx
there are x pending forwards
of which x are with offline peers
x are < 6 blocks away from timing out (~60 minutes)
````


### **üßæ getCapacityFees:** ###

Capacity-weighted median fee rates towards a node (incoming fee distribution) for your node and your peers. 

````
$ node getCapacityFees 
                            me  25%:x      50%:x     75%:x     88%:x     (n:x)

                       Peer 2  25%:1       50%:30      75%:60     88%:100     (n:x)
                       ...
````

### **üì∫ monitorPeers:** ###

Logs your and your peers' activity and forwards: graph policy updates of connected channels (base_fee_mtokens, cltv_delta, fee_rate, is_disabled, max_htlc_mtokens, min_htlc_mtokens, updated_at), peers disconnects/connects, forwardings (success/failures with reason, if provided). Start the listener in a separate terminal window (recommended).

New features: Block private channel opening requests on-the-fly. Running `monitorPeers` set `ALLOW_PRIVATE_CHANNELS` to `false` will intercept channel opening requests from peers and reject channels which contain the `private` flag. Message any event to TG bot specified in BosBot settings. Comment out `telegramLog` commands if you get spammed a lot.

## original description by legalizemath

just meant as an example of how wrapping of bos (balanceofsatoshis) can be done in node

this does everything through bos by wrapping the js functions bos uses to act on terminal commands, bos wasn't made for calling these functions directly from other projects (yet) so compatibility can easily change and should be just used as an example

this is not ready for anyone to use and was just for experimentation I was doing, there's probably errors all over this thing, it's nowhere close to a working project

`bos.js` is where I place bos function wrappers and then call them from messy experiments I'm testing out in some script file `_____.js` like `visualize.js`

DO NOT USE AS IS

DO NOT USE AS IS

DO NOT USE AS IS

assumes bos is installed globally and "bos" commands work from anywhere so then just have to run

I used these installation guides so I can run bos commands like `bos utxos` from terminal, using nodejs v14 like in instructions

* https://gist.github.com/alexbosworth/8fad3d51f9e1ff67995713edf2d20126
* https://github.com/alexbosworth/balanceofsatoshis#install
* https://github.com/alexbosworth/balanceofsatoshis#saved-nodes

Then I created package.json with `{ "type": "module" }` for imports to work, then I place wrapper `bos.js` and script like `somescript.js` file into same folder

and I run somescript.js via

```bash
npm link balanceofsatoshis && node somescript
```

npm link will link global installation that already exists to the project so it's possible to use it w/o installing new one in node_modules & setting up auth again

there's 0 package dependencies except for linking balanceofsatoshis that is already installed and using nodejs that you already need to use balanceofsatoshis

I stop it with ctrl+c
